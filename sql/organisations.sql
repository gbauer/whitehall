Our apprenticeship programmes are second to none, breaking the national average for apprenticeship completion rates by 10%. Last year, 77% of our apprentices completed their framework.
Support existing workers
We invest employer funds by providing grants to employers that are registered with CITB-ConstructionSkills. Through the Grants Scheme and our Development Funds programme, we support in excess of 23,000 businesses each year \96 giving grants to upskill workers and increase their competitive edge.

The Commission\92s primary objective is to maximise the number of effective child maintenance arrangements in place for children who live apart from one or both of their parents, whether arranged collaboratively between parents through a family-based arrangement, through the courts or through the statutory schemes.

The Commission has three core functions:

to promote the financial responsibility that parents have for their children;
to provide information and support on the different child maintenance options available;
to provide an efficient statutory maintenance service, with effective enforcement.
It has two delivery bodies: Child Maintenance Options, which provides the information and support service, and the Child Support Agency, which administers the statutory schemes. It is currently developing a new statutory service, to be launched from 2012.

The Commission is accountable to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions for its performance. For further details about the relationship between the Commission and the Department for Work and Pensions, please see the Framework Document.

The Commission\92s key priority is to support and implement the government\92s vision for the future of child maintenance. In January 2011, the government published its Green Paper Strengthening families, promoting parental responsibility: the future of child maintenance. The government is seeking to rebalance the child maintenance system so that more parents are supported to make their own family-based arrangements. The new, more efficient and effective statutory service, due to launch in 2012, will be available for parents who are unable to come to their own arrangement.

Our history
The Code of Conduct and the Standards Board for England were introduced in the 2000 Local Government Act, in response to the Nolan report and high profile standards failings in local government.

In the early days flaws in both legislation and administration attracted criticism, particularly from local government. We agreed with the need for improvement and led the call for changes to the system, lobbying for a more proportionate balance between local self regulation and national oversight.

The 2007 Local Government Act brought in a remodelled local standards framework. The new devolved regime has been up and running since May 2008. The vast majority of complaints are now dealt with by local standards committees. We only deal with the most serious.

Since July 2009 the Standards Board for England has been operating under the new name: Standards for England. We\92ve made this switch to emphasise how our role has changed. We\92ve changed the look and feel of our communications to do more to highlight the positive aspects of conduct; making the point that ethical behaviour is both a good thing in itself and good for local democracy.', 'SBE', 'http://www.standardsforengland.gov.uk/', 'Standards Board for England', 'joining');

The recent purchase of the Siegfried Sassoon Archive, for example, joins a diverse range of over 1,200 iconic objects and places which have been safeguarded by the NHMF over the last 30 years, including;

It is hard to think of such iconic heritage leaving the country or even simply rotting away, yet without the NHMF, many treasured items and places would have been lost.

The National Heritage Memorial Fund and its own history
After the Second World War, public appreciation of our national heritage was gradually forming against a backdrop of the loss of many country houses and the break-up of their estates. Despite this, the 1946 National Land Fund lay largely unused in the Treasury. The Fund was originally set up by the visionary Chancellor Hugh Dalton with a massive \A350million to purchase land and buildings as \93a thank-offering for victory and a war-memorial which would think finer than any work of art in stone of bronze\94.

By 1957 it had been reduced to only \A310million and the trigger which led to its revitalisation was the sale in 1977 of Mentmore House and its contents.

A new National Heritage Act was passed in 1980. It set up and independent board of Trustees, gave them the money remaining in the Land Fund as well as an annual grant. The National Heritage Memorial Fund was born.

This new Fund was for grants to help acquire, maintain or preserve and land, building or structure, or any object of collection which is of outstanding scenic, historic, aesthetic, architectural, scientific, or artistic interest. The \91memorial\92 title was kept to show that these grants are made to preserve in memory those who gave their lives for this country.

For the last 30 years, the Trustees of the Fund have followed these instructions. Their difficult task is to decide what should be saves within the limited resources, from within the very broad span of our National Heritage of land, buildings, documents, objects and works of art.

The National Heritage Memorial Fund and the Heritage Lottery Fund
In 1994, the NHMF and its Trustees were also given the major task of distributing the heritage share of Lottery money for good causes, which it now operates through the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF).

The NHMF continues to act as the fund of last resort, being able to act very quickly in emergencies. In contrast, Heritage Lottery Fund offers opportunities for conserving our heritage with an even greater emphasis on improved access, learning and engagement.', 'NHMF', 'http://search.hlf.org.uk/NHMFWeb/AboutTheNHMF/', 'National Heritage Memorial Fund', 'joining');

The Civil Nuclear Police Authority is independent of the Constabulary and consists of eight members; all are appointed by the Secretary of State for Energy & Climate Change.
The Chairman, two independent members and a Police Advisor independent member are selected after application and interview with four members being recommended by the nuclear industry operating companies.
Unusually for a police authority, the Civil Nuclear Police Authority is the employer of all Constabulary personnel, both police officers and police staff.  All legal transactions involving the Constabulary are carried out in the Civil Nuclear Police Authoritys name and under contracts and arrangements made by it.
Accountability

The Civil Nuclear Police Authority is primarily in place to ensure that the Constabulary polices effectively, efficiently and is responsive to the needs and priorities of the stakeholders they serve. The key responsibilities of the Civil Nuclear Police Authority therefore are to:
set the strategic direction for the Constabulary
ensure that the Constabulary has sufficient resources to carry out its functions in accordance with that strategic direction and
hold the Constabulary to account for the way in which it carries out those functions
We have put these building blocks of accountability - to the public and the government - at the foundations of our Annual Report.
Policing Strategy

Each year, we approve a Policing Plan produced by the Chief Constable setting out priorities, objectives and targets for the Constabulary over the coming year. This plan reflects both national policing and local priorities, identified through analysis of stakeholder requirements obtained after full consultation - including consultation with local stakeholder groups in areas where there is a relevant nuclear site. Operational Units and departments also develop plans on an annual basis outlining how they will contribute to the priorities, objectives and targets in the agreed Policing Plan.
Further information about these areas can be found on the Constabularys website.
The Police Authority publishes this three year Policing Plan which identifies what we intend to achieve over the next three years, including a full explanation of the strategic planning framework.
How it works

As a statutory public body entrusted with significant resources and responsibilities, the Police Authority has a duty of stewardship, not only of public money, but also in relation to relevant sites and assets within our communities.
In discharging this duty we have a strong sense of how the Police Authority must carry out its work and the things that matter in discharging its key functions.
To this end we have identified a series of key principles:
Key Principles of the Authority:
We have the confidence and active support of all stakeholders including the Government, the nuclear operating companies, our staff and the general public to whom we are responsible and accountable
We maintain total security in accordance with our responsibilities
We ensure that the Constabulary delivers a policing service that is effective and efficient, ethical and professional, responsive to the needs of all our stakeholders
We adequately resource the Constabulary, taking into account the current and anticipated needs of stakeholders
We are positive about diversity and aim to maximise the contributions of all employees.
We aim to build a Constabulary that resembles the communities that it polices and one that is free from racism, sexism and any other form of discrimination
We ensure that the Constabulary recognises the rights and fundamental freedoms of individuals and communities, aiming at all times to act proportionately, reasonably and in a way that is justified by the circumstances
We exercise strong corporate governance, scrutinising performance and striving continually for self improvement, learning from past experience and incorporating good practice from elsewhere
In embedding these key principles we aim to ensure that:
Strategic plans for governance and accountability are in place
We are visible to, and effectively engage with, stakeholders
We have effective, regular collaboration with all stakeholders to ensure we respond to their changing needs
We have a rigorous scrutiny system in place to hold the Chief Constable and Constabulary to account
We maximise efficiency and improve effectiveness
The Police Authority has started with the basics, establishing rigorous control mechanisms for the proper management of resources and governance of the Constabulary. Installing audit and risk management structures to provide internal checks that complement those outside the organisation, we have worked to ensure that any expenditure is reasonable, necessary and ultimately makes a positive contribution to the operational policing service provided by the Constabulary.
In the years that follow we will continue to build on this firm foundation and establish more refined processes and ways of working to maximise efficiency and effectiveness, demonstrating good employment practice and strong corporate governance.
What Next?

The previous sections have looked back over the past 12 months and highlighted things that have been achieved or established. However, as the strategic responsibility of the Civil Nuclear Police Authority involves an ongoing cycle, this retrospective assessment is only part of the job.
Taking the past year into account, it is necessary to look ahead at those areas of planned activity that will continue to keep the Authority and the Constabulary focused on the longer-term direction and objectives.
There are many things already on the strategic horizon, some of which include:
Review of practices and policy in light of the matters raised in Her Majestys Inspector of Constabularys baseline assessment;
Instigation of rigorous Best Value Reviews of the Constabulary Headquarters and Training functions to identify efficiency gains and maximisation of resource allocation;
A strategic conference in the autumn, looking ahead in light of the governments energy review findings and its implications for the long-term future and

The Councils Remit

The statutory provisions governing the Councils work are set out in Section 171 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. The Council has three roles:

To advise on the prescription of diseases.
To advise on matters referred to it by the Secretary of State. Draft regulations or proposals concerning the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Scheme must be referred to the Council for consideration and advice, unless they are exempted by law from such reference.
To advise on any other matter relating to Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Scheme or its administration.
The Council is a non-departmental public body and has no power or authority to become involved in individual cases or in the decision-making process.

History of the Council

The first Workmens Compensation Act passed in 1897 made no provision for industrial diseases. Subsequently, a Departmental committee identified a need for additional statutory provision and a Schedule was added to the Workmens Compensation Act of 1906, listing industrial diseases for which compensation was available. Initially only six diseases were prescribed (Anthrax; Poisoning by lead, mercury, phosphorus, arsenic; Ancylostomiasis) in respect of specific work processes. The 1906 Act also empowered the Home Secretary to add other diseases to the Schedule, though the criteria to be applied in doing so were not specified.

The Samuel Committee was appointed to inquire into this and set out to identify diseases currently not covered by the Act which, firstly, caused incapacity for more than one week, and, secondly, were so specific to the given employment that causation could be established in each individual case. Using these criteria the Committee recommended that eighteen diseases should be added to the Schedule. Further diseases were added to the schedule later, but there were no significant changes to the scheme until the setting up of the Welfare State after the Second World War. By 1948, compensation was available for 41 diseases.

The industrial Injuries Advisory Council was established under the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946. Under this Act, which came into effect on 4 July 1948, a new industrial injuries scheme was established, financed by contributions from employers, employees and the Exchequer. The State, through the scheme, assumed direct responsibility for paying no-fault compensation for injury and diseases. The Councils terms of reference, set down in the Act, were to advise the Minister on proposals to make regulations under the Act and to advise and consider such questions relating to the Act that the Minister might, from time to time, refer.

The 1946 Act also contained provisions for the prescription of diseases (section 55 of the 1946 Act, now section 76(2) of the Social Security Act 1975). The Minister could prescribe a disease if he was satisfied that it ought to be treated as a risk of occupation and not as a risk common to the general population; and that the attribution of individual cases to the nature of the occupation could be established or presumed with reasonable certainty. An employee disabled by a prescribed disease would have a right to claim benefit under the Act.

In 1947, the Government appointed the Dale Committee. Part of its brief was to advise on the principles governing the selection of diseases for insurance under the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act, having regard to the extended system of insurance which was about to be set up by the National Insurance Act 1948 and any other relevant considerations. The advice of the Dale Committee included proposals that a small specialised standing committee should be appointed by the Minister to consider the prescription of diseases specifically referred to it, to review periodically the Schedule of prescribed diseases and to recommend subjects on which more research was needed. The Minister concluded that this was a suitable task for a newly established Industrial Injuries Advisory Council. In 1982 the Government widened the Councils terms of reference, allowing it to advise the Secretary of State on any matter relating to the Industrial Injury Disablement Benefit or its administration.

Conditions for Prescribing Diseases

The conditions which must be satisfied before a disease may be prescribed in relation to any employed earners are set out in section 108(2) of the Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (formerly section 76(2) of the Social Security Act 1975). This requires that the Secretary of State for Department for Work and Pensions should be satisfied that the disease:

Ought to be treated, having regard to its causes and incidence and any other relevant considerations, as a risk of their occupations and not as a risk common to all persons; and
Is such that, in the absence of special circumstances, the attribution of particular cases to the nature of the employment can be established or presumed with reasonable certainty.
In other words, a disease can only be prescribed if the risk to workers in a certain occupation is substantially greater than the risk to the general population, and the link between the disease and the occupation can be established in each individual case or presumed with reasonable certainty.

In diseases which occur in the general population (e.g. chronic bronchitis and emphysema) there may be no difference in the pathology or clinical features to distinguish an occupational from a non-occupational cause. In these circumstances, in order to recommend prescription, IIAC looks for consistent evidence that the risk of developing the disease is more than doubled in a given occupation.

Research

The Government and IIAC rely on research carried out independently and published in the medical and scientific literature. IIAC does not have a research budget to fund scientific studies. When IIAC decides to investigate a particular area its usual practice is to ask other bodies and interested parties to submit any relevant research in that field. IIAC has a sub-committee, the Research Working Group, which meets independently of the full council a minimum of four times a year, and the secretariat has a research librarian to monitor the scientific literature to keep IIAC up to date with developments in relevant research.', 'IIAC', 'http://iiac.independent.gov.uk/', 'Industrial Injuries Advisory Council', 'joining');
insert into organisations (name, slug, organisation_type_id, description, acronym, url, logo_formatted_name, govuk_status) values('Social Security Advisory Committee', 'social-security-advisory-committee', 2, 'The Committee is the main UK advisory body on social security matters.

The Committees remit does not include industrial injuries, war pensions or occupational pensions, all of which are dealt with by other advisory bodies. Nor does the remit extend to subjects which may interrelate with social security benefits but which are not the responsibility of the Department for Work and Pensions.

For example:

social services
employment, training and education policies
health care
taxation
National Insurance contributions and Tax Credits

The Committee takes an interest in the impact of these policy areas on social security but has no statutory advisory responsibility for them.

In the case of National Insurance (NI) contributions and Tax Credits (TC), a Memorandum of Understanding between the Committee and Her Majesty Revenue and Customes (HMRC) exists. This sets up formal arrangements under which the Committee will be invited to comment on matters within HMRCs responsibility and to provide confidential advice to Treasury Ministers.

From April 2000, at the request of the Secretary of State, the Committee took on the significant new task of scrutinising the Departments public information strategy.

Responsibilities

The Committees responsibilities are:

To give advice on social security issues as it sees fit.

Under this power of initiative the Committee has examined a wide range of policy issues (for example: benefits for disabled people; and benefits for carers). It publishes its views on these general topics in its annual stewardship reports. (The Third and Fourth Reports differed from this arrangement in that they contained, respectively, the Committees evidence and response to the Governments 1984/5 review of social security.) To help in this area of its work the Committee has frequent meetings with outside organisations, makes visits to the Departments local and national delivery sites and maintains a close interest in developments in the social welfare field.

To consider and report on social security regulations referred to it.

Draft regulations or proposals for regulations must be submitted to the Committee by the Secretary of State or the Northern Ireland Department responsible for social security issues unless:

they are proposals to replicate in Northern Ireland regulations already agreed for Great Britain;
they are exempted from reference to the Committee (this applies to most regulations on the uprating of benefits and those regulations made within 6 months of the enactment of primary powers); or
following reference of a set of proposed regulations the Committee agrees that the regulations need not be formally referred.

When regulations are formally referred to the Committee, it usually initiates public consultation with interested bodies and individuals so that its reports to the Secretary of State are based on as wide a range of evidence as possible. The organisations consulted by the Committee differ according to the subject of the regulations in question. The Secretary of State is obliged to take account of the Committee\92s recommendations and, when the regulations are finally laid before the House, the Committee\92s report and a statement explaining the response to its recommendations must also be laid.

In cases of urgency, the Secretary of State may make regulations without prior reference to the Committee, and, if the matter becomes urgent after the reference to the SSAC, the regulations may be made without waiting for the Committee\92s report. In both these instances, the Committee would proceed with the consultation in the usual way and produce a report which, together with the Secretary of State\92s response, would be laid before Parliament after the regulations have been made.

To consider and advise on any matters referred to it by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions or the Northern Ireland Department responsible for social security.

The Committees views are also sought less formally on a variety of subjects, and it has the opportunity to comment on the early stages of some policy discussions. The Committee does not hold consultation exercises on these subjects, but may meet interested parties to help in formulating views. Although the Committee has no responsibility for social security operations, it takes a close interest in service to the public. Members make regular visits to local service delivery sites and other operational centres to see for themselves how things are working.

To scrutinise information products produced by the Department for Work and Pensions.

The Department and Ministers continue to be responsible for information products of all kinds whether they are in printed or electronic form, and irrespective of whether they are provided purely for the general public and/or advice agencies, or purely for staff guidance. However, the Committee examines a sample of products and contributes to the process of ensuring that leaflets are clear enough for any reasonable person to understand, and that there are no significant omissions. It also scrutinises the production and checking processes within the Department, and assesses how effectively information products are used by staff when handling customer enquiries.

Back To Top

About appointments

The Government relies on a wide range of public bodies to play a part in the process of developing and delivering national policies. Such non-departmental public bodies generally have a board or committee of appointed members who take responsibility for the functions of the body (eitherExecutive functions or advisory ones). Anyone can apply for a public appointment. The SSAC is a statutory body established by the Social Security Act 1980. It is an advisory Committee and has noExecutive functions.

All appointments are made on merit and on the basis of equal opportunity for all. The Government welcomes applications from candidates from all backgrounds who can bring the necessary skills to the Committee. All appointments are monitored by the Commissioner for Public Appointments to ensure they are made in line with proper procedures.

Constitution of the Committee

The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is required to appoint a Chair and not less than 10 or more than 13 members. Each member of the Committee is appointed by the Secretary of State to hold office for a period of not more than five years or less than three years. Appointees may serve for any number of terms up to a maximum of 10 years as long as they have been assessed by the Department as performing appropriately in accordance with the performance assessment set out in guidance issued by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments . After 10 years new candidates must be sought, though a retiring appointee may be considered in this category.

One member is appointed following consultation with employers organisations (Confederation of British Industry), one following consultation with workers organisations (Trades Union Congress), and one following consultation with the Department responsible for social security in Northern Ireland (The Department for Social Development (DSD)) The Secretary of State is also required to appoint a member who has experience of the chronically sick or disabled or someone who is chronically sick or disabled. By custom, the Committee also has a member from Wales and from Scotland.

Members are paid an attendance fee and travelling allowances to attend meetings. The SSAC may act when there are vacancies in its membership and may make its own procedural rules.

The Role of Members

The Committee meets on the first Wednesday of each month except September. Meetings last around 3-4 hours. One meeting (usually June) lasts two days and includes an overnight stay. Members are expected to attend meetings on a regular basis.

The Committees work consists largely of considering detailed, and often complex, proposals for social security regulations and of monitoring and scrutinising information products issued by the Department for Work and Pensions. Proposals for changes to regulations are normally presented as papers and sent to members in advance of meetings. Members are expected to have considered the papers before the meeting and to make a positive contribution to the Committees deliberations and to work effectively with other members.

The scrutiny of information products is normally undertaken by a postal exercise with comments being submitted in writing. However, this is a new role and the method by which this function is discharged may change.

Members are also expected to keep abreast of operational matters and to make occasional visits to local offices and to provide a short written report on their findings. There are opportunities for other visits but these are subject to members availability.

Members frequently see confidential proposals and are expected to consider them in confidence. Members are expected to refer any requests for information or interview by the media to the Secretary or the Chair and not to discuss the Committees business.

The required qualities for membership are as follows:

Essential

commitment to attend the meetings regularly and to have prepared in advance
ability to grasp the details of proposals and make a positive contribution to meetings
readiness to work as part of a team with other members in reaching decisions
discretion to keep the Committees work confidential
appreciation of the political and financial context in which social security operates and of the Committees role as adviser and not a pressure group

Desirable

general interest in social security related matters
general interest in the production, provision and use of written information material

The Work of the Committee

The SSACs responsibilities are defined in the Social Security Administration 1992 Act as:

a general duty to advise the Secretary of State for Social Security and the Department for Social Development (Northern Ireland) on virtually all social security matters except those which are the responsibility of other advisory bodies (eg industrial injuries benefits)
to consider and report on social security regulations referred under Section 172 of the Social Security Administration 1992 Act
to consider and report on issues referred by the Secretary of State and Department for Social Development (Northern Ireland) under the equivalent Northern Ireland Act

The General Advisory Duty Of The SSAC

The SSACs general advisory duty forms the basis of most of its activity, particularly where it decides to pursue issues on its own initiative. Since it was set up the Committee has examined a wide range of policy issues and published its views on these general topics in its periodic stewardship reports.

The SSAC has also taken on, at the request of the Secretary of State, a significant new task of monitoring and scrutinising the Department for Work and Pensions information products. Whilst overall responsibility for Department for Work and Pensions publications rests with the Department, the Committee adds an additional level of quality assurance.

Wherever possible the Department involves the SSAC in major social security policy developments, although major changes are sometimes made without prior consultation with the Committee. The SSAC is usually invited by the Department to participate in any public exercise in its territory, eg the question of welfare reform. Although the SSAC has no statutory responsibility for operational matters the Committee is encouraged to look at the operational implications of changes and service to the public.

Social Security Regulations

Most social security regulations come before the SSAC, the only significant exceptions being regulations which go to other advisory bodies or set benefit rates. Relief from routine and/or insignificant regulations is available, since the Act permits the SSAC to agree it does not need formal reference of particular regulations. However, they have to be considered by the SSAC, usually at a monthly meeting.

When the SSAC has considered regulations which it has asked to be formally referred, its report must be presented to Parliament when the regulations are laid with a statement from the Secretary of State showing what has been done (or is intended to be done) about the SSACs recommendations.

Where the Secretary of State decides that the regulations are needed urgently without a reference to the SSAC before they come into force, the regulations are referred to the Committee after they have been made a report then produced. Where the matter becomes urgent after referral to SSAC, the Secretary of State may proceed to make regulations urgently without waiting for the Committees report. The report and the Secretary of States response would then be produced and published at a later date.

The Northern Ireland Responsibilities of the SSAC

The Social Security Administration Act gives the SSAC virtually identical responsibilities in relation to the Northern Ireland social security system as it has for Great Britain. Although the two systems are almost identical they operate in different settings; Northern Ireland is, according to most conventional indicators, more deprived than any British region. There are also differences in social security administration, partly due to the much reduced scale of the Northern Ireland operations compared to those in Great Britain and the continued existence of rates instead of community charge or council tax.

The Northern Ireland Member of the SSAC

The Social Security Administration Act 1992 makes particular recognition of the SSACs Northern Ireland responsibilities by providing that one member must be appointed after consultation with the head of the DSD Northern Ireland. But it has always been the intention that the SSACs Northern Ireland member should be a full member of the SSAC in relation to its GB responsibilities and not be solely responsible for safeguarding Northern Ireland interests on the Committee. Similarly, all members are expected to participate fully in the consideration of Northern Ireland matters.

Because of the parity maintained between the GB and Northern Ireland social security systems, involvement of the SSAC in the great majority of social security issues or regulations initiated by the Department (GB) will invariably have just as much impact on Northern Ireland as GB. It is, therefore, necessary for the SSAC to function as a United Kingdom body in virtually all its activities.', 'SSAC', 'http://ssac.independent.gov.uk/', 'Social Security Advisory Committee', 'joining');

to promote the financial responsibility that parents have for their children;
to provide information and support on the different child maintenance options available;

To protect the benefits of members of work-based pension schemes
To promote good administration and improve understanding of work-based pension schemes
To reduce the risk of situations arising which may lead to compensation being payable from the Pension Protection Fund (PPF)
To maximise employer compliance with employer duties (including the requirement to automatically enrol eligible employees into a qualifying pension provision with a minimum contribution) and with certain employment safeguards
Our pensions reform section tells you more about automatic enrolment.

Our approach

Our role is to ensure that people responsible for providing access to and managing work-based pensions fulfil their obligations. We work with trustees, employers, pension specialists and business advisers, providing guidance and education to make clear what is expected of them and enabling them to achieve high standards.

The Growth Review invites business to take part in a fundamental assessment of what each part of Government is doing to create the best conditions for private sector growth. It is a rolling programme that will last the lifetime of this Parliament.

The outcomes of the initial phase of the Growth Review were announced in the Plan for Growth as part of Budget 2011.

Some of these trees will help to regenerate blighted industrial landscapes such as former coalfield communities and to bring new woodlands closer to urban areas.

We sustainably harvest almost five million tonnes of wood every year from Britains public forests. Thats around 44 per cent of total domestic production or 300 truckloads every day. This reduces our dependency on imported wood and provides low-carbon materials for the domestic wood-using industries, and wood for fuel and energy. The income from timber provides us with income to help offset the costs of managing the forests in our care.

As Britains largest land manager we look after nearly a million hectares of land including some of our best loved and most spectacular landscapes. Two-thirds of the estate lies within National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty or Sites of Special Scientific Interest.

Protector - The threat to Britains trees from pests and disease has never been greater. We face losing much-loved species such as oak and horse chestnut. The problem is exacerbated by greater movement of infested or disease-carrying imports and improved conditions due to climate change. Our plant health officers inspect wood imports at ports around the country to minimise the risk from foreign pests and diseases. Where outbreaks do occur our experts work with local authorities and landowners to contain and control any spread. We licence tree felling across Great Britain to protect our woodlands for generations to come.

Enabler and supporter - We provide grants, licences and advice to private woodland owners to encourage new tree planting and to help keep private forests and woodland under active and sustainable management. We also work in partnership with a wide range of public bodies, NGOs, small businesses and communities to respond to national, regional and local needs.

Conservationist - We protect species, improve habitats and protect historical sites. As climate change becomes more complex and challenging we face losing some of our native species. We are leading moves to nurture and protect rare and endangered species such as the red squirrel, the dormouse and the pearl-bordered fritillary butterfly.
We safeguard the national tree collections at Westonbirt, Bedgebury and Kilmun. These conserve more than 4000 different taxa - making it one of the most comprehensive tree collection in the world - and form just one of the ways that we are increasing the worlds natural resilience for the future.

Restorer - We take degraded land no one else wants and turn it into green space for the benefit of all. Our pioneering research and on-the-ground experience has proved we can successfully, and economically, transform brownfield sites such as old collieries and factories into usable greenspace. This improves the environment, peoples health and the local economy by restoring places that people want to work rest and play in.

Leisure and recreation provider - More people in Britain visit a forest than do the seaside. We offer visitors many thousands of waymarked walks and trails, cycle routes and bridle paths, open every day and free of charge. We have more than 150 easy access trails for people with physical difficulties. In many places, the Forestry Commission provides the only local opportunity for quiet and accessible recreation. The millions of visitors contribute some \A32 billion annually to the economy, mostly into rural areas.

Our network of visitor centres throughout England, Scotland and Wales provides a unique opportunity to engage with the public. They are an ideal platform to talk to people about climate change, helping them to understand the issues, see directly how climate change is affecting our trees and woods today, what we need to do to help them adapt, and what actions individuals and families can take to make a difference.

How we work
Having a can do approach - The combination of our hands on experience of sustainable land management, a strong commercial drive, and a foundation of robust scientific knowledge make us unique within Government. It means that we can develop and deliver policy that works on the ground.

Taking a long-term view - Forestry is a long-term business. From planting to harvesting a tree for timber takes a minimum of 40 to 50 years - around the same time-scale climate experts have given society to make the changes necessary to avoid runaway climate change. Our foresters must be just as skilled in planning for the longer term as they are for the short one. We must ensure that our forests are adapted to, and can withstand, our changing climate. If Greenhouse gas emissions do not decline, we must consider introducing new species to ensure our forests survive.  In reaching workable solutions we can pull on our substantial research knowledge whilst accepting the need to adapt as knowledge grows.

Putting sustainability first - Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do. We set the standards for the sustainable management of the UKs forests, based on internationally recognised science and best practice.  Britain was the first country in the world to have all its public forests independently certified as being sustainably managed.  We are also committed to implementing ISO14001 Environmental Management System in all parts of our business.

  Applying sound science - We have world-class scientists and researchers working to understand the science behind the big issues and provide the evidence we need to underpin policy and delivery. As climate change begins to bite, this resource becomes ever more important. Last year we produced the Read report - a ground-breaking study by an independent panel of experts, looking at the role of forests and climate change: what needs to be done; what knowledge we have to do it; and what we still need to learn. This assessment is a world-first and it is already starting to change policy, form new ideas, and raise awareness of the opportunities offered by our trees and forests.

Doing more with less - Knowing how best to manage our forests and woodland to maximum benefit doesnt mean we do it all ourselves. 70 per cent of all the operational work in our forests is done by contractors with continuous market testing. This supports SMEs and the wider industry and drives efficiency and competition.
We have always worked with centralised specialist and back office functions and we have a programme of reviewing and bench-marking these to ensure we are getting value for money.
We expect our managers at all levels to be fully accountable for their business plans and to seek efficiencies to deliver programmes of a high standard for the minimum cost.

At a glance
Reporting
The Forestry Commission is a non-Ministerial Department and a cross-border authority.

The Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is responsible for forestry in England and owns the public forest estate. The Secretary of State is also responsible for GB issues such as international affairs, plant health and research, which are funded by Westminster.

The Scottish Government has responsibility for forestry in Scotland and the Welsh Assembly Government has responsibility for forestry in Wales. The Forestry Commission reports directly to the appropriate Minister in each country.

Structure
We have a Board of Commissioners with duties and powers prescribed by statute. It consists of a Chair, Pam Warhurst, five non-executive and fourExecutive Commissioners, including its Director General, Tim Rollinson.  Forestry Commissioners are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of Ministers.

Our devolved structure allows us to focus on delivering the policies of the individual Governments while still having the ability to take a GB-wide approach to cross-border issues.

The work of the Forestry Commission in each country is overseen by a National Committee comprising non-executive andExecutive members.

We have a GB-wide research agency, Forest Research, to inform the development of forestry policies and practices, and promote high standards of sustainable forest management.

Efficiency
Back office functions including finance, human resources and information technology are centralised at our offices in Edinburgh. Operational functions such as civil, mechanical and electrical engineering and plant and seed supply are also centralised.

It makes recommendations on the remuneration of all staff paid under Agenda for Change (AfC) and employed in the NHS (for details of the NHSPRB Terms of Reference, click here). NHSPRB\92s recommendations apply to all staff in the NHS, with the exception of doctors, dentists and very senior managers. The remit group includes all staff in NHS England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and accounts for just under 1.5 million NHS staff (headcount). NHSPRB\92s annual reports are submitted jointly to the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Health, and Ministers of the Scottish Government, the Welsh Assembly Government and the Northern IrelandExecutive.

The Review Body receives evidence on pay and related issues from the Governments, NHS Employers and staff organisations. It also conducts its own research on pay and related matters. NHSPRB members visit trusts and health units to meet staff and managers to gather information and views on pay and related issues and to gain a better understanding of the roles of staff within the remit groups.

Background
The NHS Pay Review Body was originally known as the Review Body for Nurses and Allied Health Professions (NAPRB) and was set up in 1983 to advise the Government on the pay of NHS nursing staff, midwives, health visitors, and the professions allied to medicine (PAMs).

Following the introduction of Agenda for Change in late 2004, the Review Bodys remit was extended to cover all allied health and health care science professions, pharmacists, optometrists, applied psychologists and psychotherapists, as well as clinical support workers and technicians supporting these groups. To recognise this broader staff remit, the NAPRB became the Review Body for Nursing and Other Health Professions (NOHPRB).

In July 2007 the Review Bodys remit was again extended, first to cover the remaining NHS staff not within its remit but who were nevertheless paid under the Agenda for Change pay system; and second to include staff working in Northern Ireland. The Review Body was renamed the NHS Pay Review Body to reflect these changes. New staff groups covered included ancillary and maintenance and estates staff (e.g. cleaners, porters, catering, domestics, electricians, plumbers, builders); administrative and clerical (e.g. medical secretaries, ward clerks, library services staff); administrative managers; and other groups such as IM&T (e.g. analysts, technicians); HR (e.g. assistants, advisors); finance (e.g. accountants, invoice clerks, salaries and wages staff) and chaplains.

The NHSPRB is registered with the Information Commissioner as a data controller. Its registration number is Z612735X.

This includes Class A drugs, people smuggling and human trafficking, major gun crime, fraud, computer crime and money laundering.
We work to put serious criminals behind bars, and use many other tactics to fight crime and keep you safe. In particular, we want to ensure crime doesn\92t pay and that it\92s harder to commit.
The power to counter criminals

SOCA officers can have the combined powers of police, customs and immigration officers. We also have a substantial range of tools and legislation to target criminals with \96 everything from the ability to recover assets through to Serious Crime Prevention Orders. We work with agencies and officials across the UK and all over the world to help us do our job and to help them do theirs.

New ways of fighting crime

We use traditional law enforcement methods \96 investigating, and arresting criminals. We also draw on innovative new approaches to prevent crimes from happening in the first place.

Here are some examples:

First class intelligence - we use all kinds of ways to gather the knowledge we need to know where, when and how to strike to best effect.

Monitoring serious career criminals - in some cases we watch them for life, to prevent them from continuing their criminal activities in prison or after release.

Hitting them where it hurts - by taking criminals\92 cash and property. For many serious criminals, this worries them more than the prospect of going to prison.

Working in partnership - serious organised crime is a major problem that affects everyone every day, so we co-operate with law enforcement, public and private sector partners to counter it.

Worldwide operations - we go anywhere we need to when tackling criminal activity. For instance, a street drug dealer is just the last link in a chain that probably stretches to the other side of the world. So our activities aren\92t limited by borders.

Making it harder to commit crime - for example, passing on details of suspicious financial activities or forged identities to banks before frauds can take place.', 'SOCA', 'http://www.soca.gov.uk/', 'Serious Organised Crime Agency', 'joining');

MOD Police and MOD Guards working together
About the MDPGA
Protection of defence personnel and assets requires an understanding of the armed forces and of the MOD and its working methods, as well as close working relationships with other policing and physical security resources in the MOD.

Together the two organisations, MDP and MGS, now form a single intelligence community with joint Control Rooms and shared strategies for the management of security risk across the defence estate.

The MOD Police force (MDP) is a statutory police force under the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987. In 1996, the Force acquired Agency status within the MOD, and was then expanded in 2004 to include the uniformed MOD Guard Service (MGS).

Renamed the MOD Police & Guarding Agency (MDPGA), the Agency incorporates the two main physical security services within the MOD.

Simplifying the law

The Commission has a statutory obligation to simplify the law. We do this in a number of ways:

Codification of the law

The Commission believes that the law would be more accessible to the citizen, and easier for the courts to understand and apply, if it were presented as a series of statutory codes. As a preliminary step, to prepare the ground, we are working on a number of projects that aim to simplify aspects of the criminal law.

Consolidation of Statutes

Consolidation brings together under one Act all the existing statutory provisions previously located in several different Acts. The law itself remains unchanged, but those who use it can now find it all in one place.

Statute Law Repeals

Parliament has been enacting statutes for over 750 years. Although many of the older statutes have been repealed, many remain which are obsolete or unnecessary. A Statute Law (Repeals) Act enables a large number of statutes which are no longer of any practical use to be repealed together. However, while it is important to tidy up the statute book, it is just as important to avoid accidentally removing the legal basis for someones rights, and therefore a great deal of consultation is needed. Since 1965 the whole or part of nearly 5,000 enactments have been repealed by Statute Law (Repeals) Acts.

NOMS is responsible for commissioning and delivering adult offender management services, in custody and in the community, in England and Wales. It manages a mixed economy of providers. Decisions on what work is to be done and who it will be done by are based on evidence and driven by best value.

NOMS keeps the public safe by ensuring that around 260,000 offenders each year safely and securely undertake the punishment of the courts through custodial (prison) or community sentences provided through the prison and probation services. As a result, we work with a wide range of partners to deliver programmes and interventions designed to reduce reoffending.

There are currently 133 prisons in England and Wales. The management of 12 of these are contracted to private sector partners and the rest are run by the public sector through Her Majestys Prison Service.

Probation services are provided by 35 Probation Trusts across England and Wales. All of the above receive funding from NOMS to which they are accountable for their performance and delivery.', 'NOMS', 'http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/noms/', 'National Offender Management Service', 'joining');

What are the aims of the Parole Board?

The Parole Board aims to:

Make risk assessments which are rigorous, fair and timely with the primary aim of protecting the public and which contribute to the rehabilitation of prisoners where appropriate.
Demonstrate effective and accountable corporate governance by maintaining strong internal control, setting clear objectives and managing corporate risk and to deliver best value by optimum use of resources.
Promote the independence of and public confidence in the work of the Board, while effectively managing change.
What are the responsibilities of the Parole Board?

The Parole Board for England and Wales was established in 1968 under the Criminal Justice Act 1967. It became an independentExecutive Non-Departmental Public Body (NDPB) on 1 July 1996 under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. The Parole Boards role is to make risk assessments about prisoners to decide who may safely be released into the community.

The Parole Board has responsibility for considering the following types of cases:

Indeterminate sentences

These include life sentence prisoners (mandatory life, discretionary life and automatic life sentence prisoners and Her Majestys Pleasure detainees) and prisoners given indeterminate sentences for public protection (IPP). The Parole Board considers whether prisoners are safe to release into the community once they have completed their tariff (the minimum time they must spend in prison) and also whether they are safe to re-release following recall to prison for a breach of their life licence conditions (the rules which they must observe upon release).

Determinate sentences

These include discretionary conditional release (DCR) prisoners serving more than 4 years whose offence was committed before 4 April 2005 and prisoners given extended sentences for public protection (EPP) for offences committed on or after 4 April 2005. The Parole Board considers whether these prisoners are safe to release into the community once they have completed the minimum time they must spend in prison. The Board also considers any determinate sentence prisoner referred by the Secretary of State following recall to prison for a breach of their parole licence conditions (the rules which they must observe upon release) as to whether they are safe to re-release into the community.

What is a Non Departmental Public Body?

A Non Departmental Public Body (NDPB) is an independent public body which has a role in the process of national Government. It is not a government department or part of one. It operates at arms length from Government. Appointments to the boards of these public bodies are known as public appointments.

What is the budget of the Parole Board?

The Parole Boards budget for 2010-11 was \A310.98 million. The budget for 2011-12 is \A310.5 million.. The costs of the Board are largely driven by workload. Members fees and travel and subsistence represent nearly 60% of the Boards budget and expenditure.
